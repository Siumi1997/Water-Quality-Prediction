# Water-Quality-Prediction

Water is a basic human need. Also, water is a key requirement for the agriculture and industrialsectors as well. Around 1.7% of the groundwater is available in the world but only around 0.8% of the earthâ€™s water is freshwater.Even though people have a limited amount of fresh water to use, the water pollution makes thatamount even scarcer. Unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Hence, water pollution has become a major crisis in the world.The main objective of this analysis is to build a model to predict the potability of water of aresource using water quality metrics. We are also interested in finding out which factors affect the most for the potability of the water
